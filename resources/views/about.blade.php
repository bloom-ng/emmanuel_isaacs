                            time-related &
                            financial analytical skills to draw many out of the dungeons of financial slavery and wrong
                            financial mindsets. He really tries to open people’s eyes to how money works in relation to
                            certain number of variables that give money significance such as ‘TIME’. He strongly
                            believes and lives by the standard of God’s word towards the total liberation of every form
                            of man’s financial enslavement.</p>

                            We become what we overcome in life, nothing happens for nothing. You can decide the nature
                            of life you want to lead. Our choices in life are one of the most important episodes of our
                            lives. Your future is waiting for a favourable outcome of your today, while your today’s
                            experiences were drawn from the bank savings of your yesterday.</p>
